                  <h3>About Naatya Nilayam</h3>
                  <p>Dedicated institute to promote Indian traditional art Kuchipudi and encourage the unique talent of the
                    students under the guidance of Guru Swarnalatha whether the student is new to the dance or already
                    professional, Guru Swarnalatha adjusts classes to suit the age and ability of the student. She will train
                    to develop the strength of the student through her unique style of teaching kuchipudi.
                  </p>
                  <p class="mb-3">Kuchipudi dance was heavily influenced by the Natya Shastra theory of the classical
                    theatrical arts, Kuchipudi makes full use of the abhinaya, four ways of conveying meaning and emotions to
                    the audience. Angika represents the movement of the body, vachika is the use of speech which is expressed
                    through song and miming words in Kuchipudi. The aharya abhinaya represents the meaning conveyed through
                    the dancersâ€™ costumes and make-up.
                  </p>

                      <h3>Foundation</h3>
                      <p class="mb-3">The technique of Kuchipudi makes use of fast rhythmic footwork and sculpturesque body
                        movements. Stylized mime, using hand gestures and subtle facial expression, is combined with more
                        realistic acting, occasionally including dialogues spoken by the dancers. In this blend of performance
                        techniques, Kuchipudi is unique among the other Indian dance styles.
                      </p>
                      <p>Historically, Kuchipudi was performed as a dance drama, with several dancers taking different roles.
                        Kuchipudi today, is performed either as a solo or a group presentation.</p>

                  <h3>Kuchipudi</h3>
                  <p class="mb-3">A multi-layered performance, Kuchipudi combines drama, dance, sign language, mime and music
                    to create a vibrant theatrical experience for the audience. Colorful costumes, ornate headdresses, jewelry
                    and makeup are also used to convey meaning and accentuate the rhythmic movements and intricate expressions
                    of the artist.
